# Riemann's Sums Visualizer

## Description
A Python GUI program written to help students better comprehend Riemann's Sums.

## Math
This program implements a Riemann's Sum equation, evaluating the area under the curve using given intervals for each rectangle. Using the summation of the area of n rectangles given x length based off of user input, it estimates the area under a function.

## Instructions
* Install dependencies:
  * Assuming Python is properly installed, open a command window and type:
    * `pip install pillow`
   
* In a command window run 'python introScreen.py'.
